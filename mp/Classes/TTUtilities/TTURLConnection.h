 @header TTURLConnection
 
 TTURLConnection takes a URL and downloads the content to memory as NSData.
 
 This is essentially a wrapper for NSURLRequest and NSURLConnection.  This
 wrapper just helps make it simpler to download content for typical URL requests
 by reducing settings and delegates methods needed.
 
 For more connections that require more customization, use NSURLRequest and
 NSURLConnection directly.
 
 Note:
 Don't call this in any background threads.  This is already async and should not block.
 - If you do want to call this in background thread, then you need to run NRURLConnection synchronously
 NSError *error;
 NSURLResponse *response;
 NSData *connectionData = [NSURLConnection sendSynchronousRequest:theRequest returningResponse:&response error:&error];
 - But we don't do this, so don't run in background thread!!
 
 Example:
 
 
 // create connection
 TTURLConnection *newConnection = [[TTURLConnection alloc] initWithURLString:urlString];
 newConnection.delegate = self;
 newConnection.responseFormat = TTURLResponseFormatJSON;  // specify how to parse the response
 
 // start request
 [newConnection connect];           

 // then create write delegates to handle returned message
